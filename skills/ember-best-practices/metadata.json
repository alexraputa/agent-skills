Each rule includes detailed explanations, real-world examples comparing incorrect vs. correct implementations, and specific impact metrics to guide automated refactoring and code generation. Uses WarpDrive for modern data management, includes accessibility best practices leveraging ember-a11y-testing and other OSS tools, and comprehensive coverage of reactive composition, data derivation, controlled forms, conditional rendering, data requesting patterns, built-in helpers, and service architecture patterns.",
