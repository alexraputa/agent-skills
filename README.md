# Agent Skills

A collection of skills for AI coding agents. Skills are packaged instructions and scripts that extend agent capabilities.

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format.

## Ember Best Practices (Progressive Disclosure)

For Ember.js projects, use the **agents-md codemod** to inject a minimal AGENTS.md that references best practices loaded on demand:

```bash
pnpm dlx skills add NullVoxPopuli/agent-skills
```

See [the skills repo](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) for documentation on the skills tool
